Add debugging of Trusted Applications with ASLR enabled

When a Trusted Application is loaded with CFG_TA_ASLR=y, now gdb-optee.py script retrieves correct address to load symbols file at right place.
When "load_ta" is called from gdb shell, tee.elf is loaded to set a breakpoint in user_ta.c, at line 704, to retrieve where ldelf is loaded.
Segments of ldelf.elf are read to get right offsets to apply at "add-symbol-file" invocation. Furthermore, another breakpoint is set in main.c, line 168, to retrieve actual load address used for TA.
Segments are read even for .elf of TA, to compute needed offsets, and to load symbols table of specific TA at right address, allowing correct debugging via gdb shell.
